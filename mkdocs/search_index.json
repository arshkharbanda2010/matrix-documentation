The code below shows how to set the entire Everloop to green with each CSS property.\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.render()\n method must be included at the end of the \nmatrix.led()\n method to update your MATRIX device's LEDs.\n\n\n\n\n// String\nmatrix.led('green').render();\n// Hexadecimal\nmatrix.led('#00ff00').render();\n// RGB\nmatrix.led('rgb(0,255,0)').render();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease avoid using \nrgba\n.

Fix in progress!\n\n\n\n\nShape objects are methods of manipulating multiple LEDs in the Everloop at once.  Shape creation is simple, you define the shape you want to make as an object and pass it into \nmatrix.led()\n like the example below\n\n\nmatrix.led({\n  arc: 90, //arc shape that takes up 90\u00b0 of Everloop \n  color: green, //turn shape green\n  start: 0 //start shape at 0\u00b0 of Everloop\n}).render();\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Shapes\n\n\n\nInclude one of these \nshape\n properties in your shape.\n\n\narc: 90 //number of degrees to draw an arc, supports negative values\nangle: 45 //degree number to draw a single point\n\n\n\n\nShape Properties\n\n\n\nEvery Shape object must include the \ncolor\n property to render.\n\n\ncolor: 'red' //color strings, as specified above\nspin: 230 //rotate color hue ( 0 - 360 )\nstart: 0  //degree at which shape begins, arc shape only\n\n\n\n\nRotation Operation\n\n\n\nThese operate on the shapes and colors defined in the \nled\n object.\n\n\n.rotate(angle); //rotates whole shape by number of degrees \n\n\n\n\nmatrix.led({\n    arc: 45,\n    color: 'blue',\n    start: 50\n}).rotate(90).render();\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Shapes\n\n\n\nUse an array in the \nmatrix.led()\n method to include multiple shapes.\n\n\n// make a smiley face\nmatrix.led([\n  //left eye angle\n  {\n    angle: 45,\n    color: 'yellow'\n  },\n  //right eye angle\n  {\n    angle: 135,\n    color: 'yellow'\n  },\n  //smile arc\n  {\n    arc: 90,\n    color: 'yellow',\n    start: 225\n  }\n]).render();\n\n\n\n\nDirect LED Manipulation\n\n\n\nArray index indicates the LED to change. The index of an LED is labeled directly above the LED on your MATRIX device (D1, D2, D3, D4, etc..). Use 0 to turn off the LED.\n\n\nmatrix.led([0, 0, 0, 0, 'yellow', 0,\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'yellow', 0, 0,\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'yellow', 'yellow',\n'yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow',\n'yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow']).render();\n\n\n\n\nLED Animation\n\n\nBy using a \nsetInterval()\n method, you can animate the LEDs on the Everloop. Below is an example of an active clock that demonstrates this. \n\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  var time = new Date();\n  var h = time.getHours();\n  var m = time.getMinutes();\n  var s = time.getSeconds();\n\n  var hourLED = {\n    // translate hours (12) to angle (360)\n    arc: h * 3,\n    color: 'blue'\n  };\n\n  var minuteLED = {\n    // translate minutes ( 60 ) to angle ( 360 )\n    angle: m * 6,\n    color: 'green'\n  };\n\n  var secondLED = {\n    // translate seconds (60) to angle (360)\n    angle: s * 6,\n    color: 'yellow',\n  };\n\n  // will draw all three\n  matrix.led([hourLED, minuteLED, secondLED]).render();\n\n}, 1000);\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Use\n\n\nEnable \nSUN_MODE=true\n as a flag, when launching MATRIX OS, to turn on the white LEDs (and the luminence calculations).

This can be used to query sensors and control any MATRIX device from any language that supports Protocol Buffers (version 3.X) and ZeroMQ. This is the basis for how the \nMATRIX OS\n layer can communicate with your MATRIX device. \n\n\n\n\nPorts \n Protocol\n\n\nMATRIX CORE contains drivers (components \n sensors) that communicate with your MATRIX device. This occurs by having each driver send or receive Protocol Buffers over a ZeroMQ driver port. Depending on the driver port it may allow for \nread-only\n, \nwrite-only\n or \nread-write\n.\n\n\nCurrent Driver Base Ports:\n\n\n\n\nIMU\n - \n20013\n\n\nHumidity\n - \n20017\n\n\nEverloop\n - \n20021\n\n\nPressure\n - \n20025\n\n\nUV\n - \n20029\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServo\n - \n20045\n\n\nGPIO\n - \n20049\n\n\nWakeword\n - \n60001\n\n\n\n\nEach driver reserves 4 ports beginning with their \nbase port\n as shown above.

Note, not all drivers utilize every port.\n\n\nAll IMU Ports\n\n\n\n\nIMU Base Port\n - \n20013\n\n\nIMU Keep-Alive Port\n - \n20014\n\n\nIMU Error Port\n - \n20015\n\n\nIMU Data Update Port\n - \n20016\n\n\n\n\nThe following list contains the port types currently defined in MATRIX CORE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Port\n\nThe \nbase port\n is used to configure a driver on your MATRIX device. This port is a \nZeroMQ PULL port\n that accepts a configuration which is created as a protocol buffer.\n\n\nTo send a configuration you need to create a valid message for each driver. For example, the UV driver uses a configuration message to set the refresh rate and timeout for sending UV data.\n\n\nConfiguration messages are named \nDriverConfig\n. The file for where this is defined can be seen \nhere\n.\n\n\nBelow is an example for a UV configuration message:\n\n\nmessage DriverConfig {\n  // Delay between updates. In seconds.\n  float delay_between_updates = 1;\n  // Timeout after last ping.\n  float timeout_after_last_ping = 2;\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnce the \nDriverConfig\n message is filled out, it needs to be serialized as a string and sent to the ZeroMQ configuration port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep-alive Port\n\n\nPort\n: \nbase port\n + 1\n\n\nThe Keep-alive port is a \nZeroMQ PULL port\n that is required for certain drivers to keep their function alive. Drivers that are pushing data need this in place to let it know if data will continue to be requested. For example, the Everloop driver doesn't require Keep-alive messages, but the Humidity driver does. Any message that is sent to the Keep-alive port will be discarded, so an empty string \n\"\"\n makes for a good Keep-alive message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Port\n\n\nPort\n: \nbase port\n + 2\n\n\nPrograms can subscribe to this port to receive driver related errors. The Error port is a \nZeroMQ PUSH port\n that will send you a string with any errors that it has encountered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Update Port\n\n\nPort\n: \nbase port\n + 3\n\n\nThis \nZeroMQ PUSH port\n is used by drivers that send data (Humidity, UV, etc.). Each driver uses a different message to report data to programs that subscribe for these updates.\n\n\nTo demonstrate, the UV driver will be used as an example. You can find the file \nhere\n.\nThe message follows:\n\n\n// Basic UV radiation lecture.\nmessage UV{\n  // UV index\n  float uv_index = 1;\n  // OMS risk\n  string oms_risk = 2;\n}\n\n\n\n\nApplications that subscribe to UV driver updates will receive a string with serialized messages of type UV. Once received, the message needs to be deserialized by the application for the values can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nWe currently provide libraries and examples for the following languages:\n\n\n\n\nJavascript\n\n\nPython\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use another protocol buffer supported programming language then we suggest you view the \nProtocol Buffers Documentation\n for the language you want to use in MATRIX CORE.

You can download this example \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Variables\n\nBefore we go into connecting to each port, the variables defined below are needed in order to access the ZeroMQ and MATRIX Protocol Buffer libraries for Javascript. We also define a few helpful variables for easy references.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:0\u0003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Port\n\nHere is where the main logic for our Everloop example goes. Once we connect to the **Base Port**, the program will start an endless loop to create and send LED configurations with randomly generated RGBW values. However, before sending the LED configuration to you MATRIX device, it will wait until the amount of `matrix_device_leds` is defined.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:1\u0003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep-alive Port\n\nThe next step is to connect and send a message to the **Keep-alive Port**. That message, an empty string, will grant us a response from the **Data Update Port** with the value we need for `matrix_device_leds`.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:2\u0003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Port\n\nConnecting to the **Error Port** is optional, but highly recommended if you want to log any errors that occur within MATRIX CORE.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:3\u0003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Update Port\n\nA connection to the **Data Update Port** will allow us to receive the LED count we want for the `matrix_device_leds` variable. Once that variable is set, the MATRIX device will begin reading the Everloop images being sent to the base port.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:4\u0003\n\n\nData Output\n\nThe javascript object below is an example output you'll receive from the **Data Update Port**.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:5\u0003",

We also define a few helpful variables and the path for our  Sphinx Knowledge Base  files.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:0\u0003    Base Port \nHere is where the configuration for our wakeword example goes. Once we connect to the **Base Port**, we will pass a configuration to the Wakeword driver. With this we can set our wakeword configurations.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:1\u0003    Keep-alive Port \nThe next step is to connect and send a message to the **Keep-alive Port**. That message will grant us a response from the Data Update Port with the wake words that were understood.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:2\u0003    Error Port \nThe **Error Port** connection is also taken care of by the `utils import`. Below we define a function to be called and given any error messages that occur within MATRIX CORE.\n> The Error Port is currently reporting false errors.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:3\u0003    Data Update Port \nA connection to the **Data Update Port** is then made to allow us to receive each custom phrase the Wakeword driver picks up.\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:4\u0003",
