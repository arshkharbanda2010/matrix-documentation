# MATRIX Ecosystem Overview
<h5 style="padding-top:0; font-weight:500;">Objective: Hardware shouldn't be hard</h5>
The MATRIX Ecosystem was created to make powerful hardware projects very approachable for software developers. The pillars of MATRIX, computer vision, hardware interfaces, distributed internet communication, and data-driven end-user clients, are all programming disciplines which require years for an individual to master, or for a team to build a solution around.

<br/>
## Programming Layers

The MATRIX platform adds powerful capabilities to your Raspberry Pi, depending on your background and the kind of application you want to write, you may need to decide on which layer best fits your need. The documentation is organized according to these layers:

<h3 style="padding-top:0;">MATRIX HAL</h3>
**Language:** C++

Interacts with the kernel modules by using C++ drivers, enabling it to access available sensors and components on your device.

<h3 style="padding-top:0;">MATRIX CORE</h3>
**Languages:** Over 40 (Examples in Javascript & Python)

Abstraction layer for **MATRIX HAL**. Hosts a ZeroMQ + Protobuf communication layer which makes device information accessible via high-level interfaces. Supports 40+ different languages through Protocol Buffers: C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, etc.<br/>

<h3 style="padding-top:0;">MATRIX Open System (MOS)</h3>
**Language:** Javascript

Highest level of abstraction integrating with MATRIX hardware via **MATRIX CORE**. This layer requires an online connection and offers an integrated IoT environment that's easy to use.
