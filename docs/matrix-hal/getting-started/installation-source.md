Before starting, ensure you have access to the terminal of your Raspberry Pi via an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/" target="_blank">SSH-session</a> or connect a screen, mouse, and keyboard.

echo "deb https://apt.matrix.one/raspbian $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrixlabs.list
```

Update your repository and packages.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the MATRIX init package and tools needed to build MATRIX HAL.

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ git libfftw3-dev wiringpi libgflags-dev matrixio-creator-init
