## Reinstall MATRIX Init Package and Reflash FPGA and MCU

If you experience strange behavior, reinstall the MATRIX init package and reflash FPGA and MCU.

Uninstall the `matrixio-creator-init` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get --purge remove matrixio-creator-init
```

Reboot your device.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Add the MATRIX repository and key.

```bash
curl https://apt.matrix.one/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.matrix.one/raspbian $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrixlabs.list
```

Update your repository and packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the `matrixio-creator-init` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get install matrixio-creator-init
```

Reboot your device.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

> FPGA will be reflashed with stock firmware.

Now you can flash the FPGA.

Reset the FPGA.

```bash
echo 18 > /sys/class/gpio/export 2>/dev/null
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value
```

Flash the FPGA.

```bash
cd /usr/share/matrixlabs/matrixio-devices/
xc3sprog -c matrix_creator blob/system_creator.bit -p 1
```

You should receive the following.

```bash

```

Reset the FPGA.

```bash
echo 26 > /sys/class/gpio/export 2>/dev/null
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio26/direction  
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio26/value  
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio26/value  
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio26/value
```

> MCU will be reflashed with stock firmware.

Now you can flash the MCU.

```bash
cd /usr/share/matrixlabs/matrixio-devices/
sudo openocd -f cfg/sam3s_rpi_sysfs.cfg
```

The last part of the `openocd` flashing command output should be the following.

```bash

shutdown command invoked
```

Power off your device.

```bash
sudo poweroff
```

Wait until the green led on your Raspberry Pi blinks 10 times, then unplug the power cable from your Raspberry Pi.

Plug the power cable back into your Raspberry Pi.

## Reinstall MATRIX Kernel Modules

If you experience strange behavior, reinstall the MATRIX kernel modules.

Uninstall the `matrixio-kernel-modules` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get --purge remove matrixio-kernel-modules
```

Reboot your device.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Add the MATRIX repository and key.

```bash
curl https://apt.matrix.one/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.matrix.one/raspbian $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrixlabs.list
```

Update your repository and packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the `matrixio-kernel-modules` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get install matrixio-kernel-modules
```

Reboot your device.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Check Raspberry Pi GPIO

If you experience strange behavior, check the Raspberry Pi GPIO.

```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
```

You should receive the following.

```bash
gpiochip0: GPIOs 0-53, parent: platform/3f200000.gpio, pinctrl-bcm2835:
 gpio-4   (                    |sysfs               ) in  hi
 gpio-16  (                    |sysfs               ) out lo
 gpio-17  (                    |sysfs               ) in  hi
 gpio-18  (                    |sysfs               ) out hi
 gpio-19  (                    |sysfs               ) out hi
 gpio-20  (                    |sysfs               ) out hi
 gpio-21  (                    |sysfs               ) out hi
 gpio-22  (                    |sysfs               ) in  lo
 gpio-23  (                    |sysfs               ) out hi
 gpio-27  (                    |sysfs               ) in  hi
```

If `sysfs` above is replaced with `w1`, use raspi-config to disable the 1-Wire interface.

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Inside raspi-config, navigate to `Interfacing Options` >> `1-Wire` >> `NO`.

## Hardware Tests

These tests will check if your MATRIX Creator is functioning properly.

We first need to install matrixio-creator-init, which handles the flashing of FPGA.

Add the MATRIX repository and key.

```bash
curl https://apt.matrix.one/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.matrix.one/raspbian $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrixlabs.list
```

Update your repository and packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the MATRIX init package.

```bash
sudo apt-get install matrixio-creator-init
```

Reboot your device.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Matrix Init Script

After the reboot, run the matrix init script manually.

```bash
sudo /usr/share/matrixlabs/matrixio-devices/matrix-init.bash
```

You should receive the following.

```bash
**** MATRIX Creator FPGA has been programmed!
INFO: [/dev/spidev0.0] was opened
FPGA IDENTIFY = 5c344e8
FPGA VERSION = 1000a
*** MATRIX Creator initial process has been launched
*** Running the program instead of the bootloader
EM358 MCU was programmed before. Not programming it again.
Running the program instead of the bootloader
SAM3 MCU was programmed before. Not programming it again.
```

If you have the matrixio-kernel-modules installed, you should receive this instead.

```bash
**** MATRIX Creator FPGA has been programmed!
INFO: [/dev/matrixio_regmap] was opened
FPGA IDENTIFY = 5c344e8
FPGA VERSION = 1000a
*** MATRIX Creator initial process has been launched
*** Running the program instead of the bootloader
EM358 MCU was programmed before. Not programming it again.
Running the program instead of the bootloader
SAM3 MCU was programmed before. Not programming it again.
```

### FPGA Info

This program checks the fpga info.

```bash
sudo /usr/share/matrixlabs/matrixio-devices/fpga_info
```

You should receive the following.

```bash
INFO: [/dev/spidev0.0] was opened
FPGA IDENTIFY = 5c344e8
FPGA VERSION = 1000a
```

If you have the matrixio-kernel-modules installed, you should receive this instead.

```bash
INFO: [/dev/matrixio_regmap] was opened
FPGA IDENTIFY = 5c344e8
FPGA VERSION = 1000a
```

### FPGA Flash

If you donâ€™t get the proper FPGA info you will need to run the FPGA flashing process.

```bash
cd /usr/share/matrixlabs/matrixio-devices/
sudo ./fpga-program.bash
```

You should receive the following.

```bash
**** MATRIX Creator FPGA has been programmed!
INFO: [/dev/spidev0.0] was opened
FPGA IDENTIFY = 5c344e8
FPGA VERSION = 1000a
```

If you have the matrixio-kernel-modules installed, you should receive this instead.

```bash
**** MATRIX Creator FPGA has been programmed!
INFO: [/dev/matrixio_regmap] was opened
FPGA IDENTIFY = 5c344e8
FPGA VERSION = 1000a
```
